# Schlosskirsch
This game is going to be a story-driven top down shoot them up. Code, graphics and music will all be originally produced by me (if I don't find any professionals). This is a passion project with no commercial interest. Built with C# and Monogame

#Building and running
Visual Studio 2017 or later is required. Just clone the repository, restore the Nuget Packages and it should build and run!
